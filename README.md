# (Paper title)

In this GitHub repository we include all datasets and code used for the analysis made on a paper to define and study the consecuences of a better definition of tax effort. 

The goal is to find relations between variables and see if they confirm an economic rationale. For example, assuming low tax effort tends to more economic activity and a faster capitalisation of economic agents, then wealth (measured as GDP) should grow in a faster pace than other countries with high tax effort and similar GDP per capita levels.
